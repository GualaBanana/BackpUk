# SyncTool
SyncTool helps you to keep back-ups of the folders that are important to you.

## Why did I decide to start this project?
One day, my mind like suddenly became aware of how this, as turned out, very simple utility works. It just clicked inside my head without any precedents. This project, so far, is the one I was excited the most to work on, for some reason. Maybe it's this simplicity and indespensable functionality that it cunningly combines. It's worth noting that my diverse skillset and hands-on experience in writing structured and well-thought code became much bigger than they used to be before I started, by the time of finishing up with writing v1.0.0 and they will keep growing with the following versions.
